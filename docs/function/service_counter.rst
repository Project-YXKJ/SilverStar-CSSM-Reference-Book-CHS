Service counter
===============

Using service counter allows users to remind regular mechanical maintenance.

**Here is a formula**:

Remaining amount = reset value of the bobbin thread counter(A61) â€“ bobbin thread counter value(A63).

**Setup steps**:

- Set an appropriate value for **A62**, every time N stitches are sewn which set by parameter **A63**, the counter(O44) increases by 1.
- Set an appropriate value for **A61**, this is a very variable value, which depends on how often you want to maintain.
- Enable counter.
- As the sewing, the remaining thread amount(A61-A63) is counted down, when it reaches 0, the machine will stop, and the controller will throw a warning(Code 7). A reset is needed if you want continue.
